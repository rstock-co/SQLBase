# SQLBase

SQLBase is a fully featured Relational database platform that enables users to “without code”, create a database, generate data, query, and visualize the data with charts. 

## Features

### Auto Generated Schema & ERD Diagrams

With powerful form tools, users can auto generate SQL database code to kick start their next tech project.  Schema code can be exported, and also visualized with auto generated ERD diagrams.

### Database Creation and Data Seeding

With a button click, schema language can be used to create a real SQL database, and then seeded with fake data to ensure that the database is designed exactly to spec.

### Query Builder

Simple or advanced SQL Queries can be built with form tools and then executed on a database to return and display the results in newly generated tables.

### Data Visualization via Charts

SQLBase uses modern React charting libraries to visualize the data relationships between tables in a relational database by generating highly usable and visually appealing charts.
